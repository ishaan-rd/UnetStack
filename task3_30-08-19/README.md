# Mobility model

Create a mobility model with one node initially the node will be at rest after 60 seconds the node should start to move linearly with speed of 1 mps then after  180 seconds the node dives to depth with 0.1 mps after 300 seconds turn the node at 2 dps and at 360 again the node moves linearly. plot the graph to track the movement of node.
